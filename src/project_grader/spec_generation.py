Create a DRAFT project-specific grading specification for an
engineering computing assignment.

PROJECT FOLDER NAME:
{project_path.name}

IMPORTANT RULES:

1. Use only the supplied project materials as authoritative
   evidence about what students were asked to do.

2. Treat the ORIGINAL PUBLISHED ASSIGNMENT material in project/
   as the primary authority for student requirements. Generated
   project_instructions.md, instructor rubric/guidance, and the
   reference solution may clarify grading, but they must not add
   requirements that are absent from the published assignment.

3. Do not invent grading requirements.

4. Instructor rubric/guidance may define grading policy and
   partial-credit rules when the published assignment does not
   specify criterion-level allocations.

5. A reference solution is evidence of one valid approach.
   Do not silently treat it as the only acceptable solution
   unless the published assignment requires that method.

6. Use known_ambiguities ONLY for unresolved grading decisions
   that require explicit instructor judgment before grading can
   be defensibly approved.

7. Do NOT create a blocking ambiguity merely because:
   - the assignment explicitly allows student choice;
   - multiple technically valid implementations are permitted;
   - an engineering judgment is sample-dependent and can be
     evaluated from the student's evidence;
   - a filename/export mechanism is not further specified but
     the required deliverable itself is clear; or
   - the JSON task structure differs from the assignment's
     section labels without changing points or requirements.

8. Represent non-blocking flexibility with acceptable_alternatives,
   evidence requirements, feedback guidance, or review triggers
   rather than known_ambiguities.

9. If the materials are genuinely contradictory, incomplete, or
   do not define enough information for a defensible grading rule,
   record the issue in known_ambiguities and do not silently resolve it.

10. Where criterion-level point allocations are not explicitly
    published, you may propose a reasonable draft allocation.
    Record that allocation as a known ambiguity ONLY when the
    instructor must explicitly accept or revise it before grading.

11. Set:
       schema_version = "1.0"
       spec_version = "0.1"
       status = "draft"

12. Use the exact SOURCE IDs supplied below when populating
    source_refs.

13. Criterion points must sum to their task max_points.

14. Task max_points must sum to project.total_points exactly.

15. If the published assignment assigns points to a separate
    Deliverables section, represent that scored section as a task
    in tasks in addition to listing the required files under
    deliverables. Do not leave published deliverable points outside
    the scored task total.

16. Include evidence requirements and review triggers when
    appropriate.

17. Preserve explicitly required methods, functions,
    software, filenames, variable ordering, plots, model
    structure, deliverables, and reproducibility requirements.

18. Allow technically valid alternatives when the published
    project does not prescribe a unique implementation.

19. Return ONLY a JSON object. Do not use Markdown fences,
    explanations, or commentary outside the JSON.
